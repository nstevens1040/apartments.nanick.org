This location is a 10 minute walk from the UP-N Union Pacific North at the Rogers Park stop. This location is in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago. Nearby parks include Paschen Park, Pottawattomie Park and Matanky Park.\n\nApartment Features:\n- 2 large bedrooms (New LVP flooring)\n- 2 full bathrooms\n- Comes with a storage locker\n- Gas and Heat Included\n- Plenty of cabinet and closet space\n- Living room (LVP)\n- Dining Room (LVP)\n- Stainless Steel Appliances\n- Parking is available for an extra $125 a month!\n- Pay Laundry in the building\n- NO pets\n\n-A one time admin fee will be charged please ask your agent for details\n\nSpanning the lakefront roughly from Devon Avenue to Howard Street, Rogers Park has the distinction of being the city's northernmost neighborhood. This distance from downtown may play a hand in why many local haunts have that under-the-radar appeal. But easy accessibility by way of multiple train stops means that the unique dining, arts, culture and entertainment found in Rogers Park are never too far away. And the sound of waves crashing along the shores is near as well, as nearly all the streets leading you east end at public beaches and parkland on Lake Michigan.\n\nIn addition to rent a Bundled Services rent charge applies.\n\nThe Rogers Park neighborhood holds another distinction: it is considered one of the most diverse in Chicago. As a home to people from all over the world, there is no single dominant ethnicity but rather its residents speak nearly 40 different languages and hail from over 80 countries. This rich tapestry has a dynamic edge to it and as a community, there has been a visible effort to work together to revitalize public spaces and support local businesses.\n\nAll lease incentives (rent concessions and/or rent credits) advertised are based on the advertised market rate of the unit. Actual credits will be the per diem value of the advertised amount as a percentage of the actual rent paid by the tenant.\n\nThis apartment is listed with Kass Management Services, Inc.

This distance from downtown may play a hand in why many local haunts have that under-the-radar appeal. But easy accessibility by way of multiple train stops means that the unique dining, arts, culture and entertainment found in Rogers Park are never too far away. And the sound of waves crashing along the shores is near as well, as nearly all the streets leading you east end at public beaches and parkland on Lake Michigan.\n\nIn addition to rent a Bundled Services rent charge applies.\n\nThe Rogers Park neighborhood holds another distinction: it is considered one of the most diverse in Chicago. As a home to people from all over the world, there is no single dominant ethnicity but rather its residents speak nearly 40 different languages and hail from over 80 countries. This rich tapestry has a dynamic edge to it and as a community, there has been a visible effort to work together to revitalize public spaces and support local businesses.\n\nAll lease incentives (rent concessions and/or rent credits) advertised are based on the advertised market rate of the unit. Actual credits will be the per diem value of the advertised amount as a percentage of the actual rent paid by the tenant.\n\nThis apartment is listed with Kass Management Services, Inc.

MORSE AVE\nRogers Park\n\nLocated on the far north side of Chicago and adjacent to Lake Michigan, Rogers Park is definitely one of the city’s most beautiful neighborhoods – all year round! Despite its humble beginnings as a small village, Rogers Park has grown into one of Chicago’s most iconic community areas. Historically settled by farmers and subsequently home to various groups of immigrants, it is also one of Chicago’s most diverse neighborhoods. Situated between Northwestern University (Evanston) and Loyola University Chicago, Rogers Park is inclusive, culturally rich, and forward-thinking. Thanks to the excellent public transportation available, residents can easily reach downtown Chicago, or make their way out to the suburbs. Those who enjoy the outdoors can relax on one of several beaches in warm weather, go for walks or bike rides along the Lakeshore, and even leave their own mark on the neighborhood during “The Artists of the Wall Festival” in the summertime.\n\nThings to Do:\nRecreation: Lake Michigan, its beaches, & many parks – Triangle, Rogers, Howard, Leone, Loyola, Tobey Prinz, Hartigan, Willye B.
